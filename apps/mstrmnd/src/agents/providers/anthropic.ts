/**
 * Streams from the Messages API over SSE.
 *
 * Uses `expo/fetch` rather than the global: React Native's fetch is built on
 * XMLHttpRequest and exposes no `response.body`, so token-by-token streaming is
 * only possible through the WinterCG implementation. On web it delegates to the
 * browser's fetch, which streams natively.
 *
 * The key is read from device storage and the call goes straight to Anthropic —
 * fine for a personal board, but it does mean the key lives on the device. See
 * README "Bringing your own key" before shipping this to other people.
